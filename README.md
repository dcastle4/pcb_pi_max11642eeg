# Maxim MAX11642EEG ADC PCB for the Pi

This repo contains KiCad design files for an ADC board for the Raspberry Pi. The board uses a MAX11642EEG by Maxim which allows for 16 inputs, all of which are mapped to the first two screw terminals. The last screw terminal carries +5V and ground leads.

A picture of the PCB from Pcbnew's 3D viewer can be seen here:
